**Research Description**

This study analyzes the impact of the tourism sector on the Gross Regional  Domestic Product (GRDP) in 34 provinces of Indonesia from 2018 to 2020. Understanding the contribution of tourism to economic growth is crucial, as it is a key driver of economic development and employment opportunities in Indonesia, a country rich in cultural and natural attractions. This research
uses the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) framework from UNWTO to measure the total impact of tourism, which in this case is Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP). 

**Purposes of the Study**
The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of tourism development on regional economic performance and unemployment in Indonesia, focusing on the 34 provinces from 2018 to 2020. Specifically, this research aims to: 
- Investigate the role of human development, tourism-related activities, and investment (both foreign and domestic) in influencing Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment rates at the provincial level.
- Examine the spatial spillover effects of tourism growth and its broader economic implications.
- Identify the localized factors that drive economic outcomes and unemployment, accounting for within-province variations.



**Data**

The dataset used in this study contains information on the impact of tourism on Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) in 34 provinces of Indonesia from 2018 to 2020. The variables include the number of foreign and domestic tourists as treatment variables, with GRDP as the outcome variable. The control variables are macroeconomic conditions (tourism employment, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and Domestic Direct Investment (DDI)), human capital (Human Development Index), infrastructure (number of accommodations), and population density. All data were sourced from Statistic Indonesia, except for the number of tourism employments, which was obtained from the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy.

**File Structure**

The main file is found as code.R. The ESS dataset is in the present folder as ESS-Data-Wizard.csv, while the series of control variables is found in the Data folder. It is best to clone the file structure to your local system to run the code without error.

**Methodology**

This study applies fixed-effects estimation and spatial data analysis to examine the impact and spillover of tourism-related factors on Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment rates across Indonesian provinces from 2018 to 2020.
