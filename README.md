Regional Tourism Dynamics in Indonesia: A Spatial and Fixed Effect Analysis of Economic Performance and Unemployment in 34 Provinces (2018-2020)

**National Chengchi University (政大）**


**Research Description**

This study analyzes the impact of the tourism sector on the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) in 34 provinces of Indonesia from 2018 to 2020. Understanding the contribution of tourism to economic growth is crucial, as it is a key driver of economic development and employment opportunities in Indonesia, a country rich in cultural and natural attractions. This research uses the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) framework from UNWTO to measure the total impact of tourism on the GRDP.

**Purposes of the Study**

The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of tourism development on regional economic performance and unemployment in Indonesia, focusing on the 34 provinces from 2018 to 2020. Specifically, this research aims to:

- Investigate the role of human development, tourism-related activities, and investment (both foreign and domestic) in influencing Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment rates at the provincial level.

- Examine the spatial spillover effects of tourism growth and its broader economic implications.

- Identify the localized factors that drive economic outcomes and unemployment, accounting for within-province variations.

The dataset used in this study contains information on the impact of tourism on the Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) in 34 provinces of Indonesia from 2018 to 2020. The variables include the number of foreign and domestic tourists as treatment variables, with GRDP as the outcome variable. The control variables are macroeconomic conditions (tourism employment, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and Domestic Direct Investment (DDI)), human capital (Human Development Index), infrastructure (number of accommodations), and population density. All data were sourced from Statistic Indonesia, except for the number of tourism employments, which was obtained from the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy.

**File Structure**

Data File: The cleaned data for the tourism dataset is available in the file IJASE-AnalysisofTheRoleofTourisminTheEconomyinIndonesia.xlsx.

Code Files:

- Map and Spatial Analysis: Contains all code for map and spatial analysis, including ggplot, Moran’s I, Lisa cluster, etc. This code is located in the folder Map and Spatial Analysis.R.

- Panel Regression (Spatial and Fixed Effect): Contains all causality or regression code and is located in the file Panel Regression (Spatial and Fix effect).R.

To ensure the code runs without error, it is recommended to clone the file structure to your local system.

**Methodology**

This study applies fixed-effects estimation and spatial data analysis to examine the impact and spillover of tourism-related factors on Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment rates across Indonesian provinces from 2018 to 2020.


**Results**

This study concludes that tourism development, particularly international tourism, plays a
significant role in influencing economic performance and reducing unemployment in
Indonesian provinces. The fixed effect regression analysis indicates that foreign tourism has
a statistically significant positive impact on GRDP, highlighting its importance in boosting
economic activities. In contrast, domestic tourism does not show a significant effect on
GRDP. Additionally, foreign tourism is found to significantly reduce unemployment rates,
while domestic tourism does not have a notable impact on employment levels. The spatial
analysis indicates that economic activities and unemployment rates demonstrate spatial
clustering. Additionally, there is a positive spatial autocorrelation between Gross Regional
Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment, suggesting that regions with higher GRDP
or lower unemployment tend to be geographically close to each other. However, the study
observes limited regional spillover effects, implying that economic benefits are mostly
confined within individual provinces or regions.
These findings underscore the need for targeted policies that enhance infrastructure and
promote sustainable tourism practices to maximize tourism’s potential for regional
development. Unlike domestic tourism, the study highlights that foreign tourism significantly
contributes to economic growth and reduces unemployment. This disparity suggests that
infrastructure and service quality, crucial for attracting and retaining international tourists,
may be inadequate to fully leverage the potential of domestic tourism. Policymakers should
focus on attracting more international tourists through targeted marketing campaigns,
simplified visa procedures, and investment in tourism infrastructure. Simultaneously,
creating travel incentives, improving infrastructure, and promoting local attractions are key
for boosting domestic tourism. Investing in education and healthcare will enhance workforce
productivity and overall economic growth. Encouraging foreign direct investment through
incentives and public-private partnerships can further develop tourism. Additionally, better
urban planning and promoting rural tourism can mitigate the negative effects of high
population density. These strategies aim to maximize the economic benefits of both foreign
and domestic tourism, fostering sustainable and inclusive growth.
